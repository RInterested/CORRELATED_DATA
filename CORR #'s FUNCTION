correlatedValue = function(x, r){
  r2 = r**2
  ve = 1-r2
  SD = sqrt(ve)
  e  = rnorm(length(x), mean=0, sd=SD)
  y  = r * x + e

# Entering a vector of values (x), and a desired correlation with the output (y), expressed as r (0 to 1), we'll get
# a vector y of correlated values. Check with

cor(x,y)
