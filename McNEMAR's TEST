# 1300 pts and 1300 matched controls are studied. 
# The smoking status is tabled as follows:
  
#               Normal   
#             |no     |yes|
# Cancer|No   |1000   |40 |
#       |Yes  |200    |60 |
  
# Each entry of the table shows information about a CASE-CONTROL PAIR: 
# 1000 means in 1000 case-control pairs, neither was a smoker. 
#40 is the number of case-control pairs where control was smoker 
#and cancer patient was not, and so on. 
#Following R code can be used to generate this table and do McNemar's Test:

mat = as.table(rbind(c(1000, 40), c( 200, 60) ))
colnames(mat) <- rownames(mat) <- c("Nonsmoker", "Smoker")
names(dimnames(mat)) = c("Cancer", "Normal")
mat

mcnemar.test(mat)

# McNemar's test is also used to assess effect of an 
# intervention on a binary outcome variable. 
# The pair of before-after outcome is tabled and tested as above.

# If smoking status is listed in your dataframe mydf as follows:
  
#   pairID  cancer  control
#     1       1       1
#     2       1       1
#     3       1       0
#     ...

# McNemars test can be done with following R commands:

tt = with(mydf, table(cancer, control))
tt
mcnemar.test(tt)
